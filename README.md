# Spotify Widget

A cross-platform application that shows a small Spotify widget that you can keep in the corner of your desktop while working.

Tech stack:

- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/): Embeds Chromium and Node.js to enable web developers to create desktop applications.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A build tool that significantly improves the front-end development experience
- [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/): A brutally efficient declarative JS library for building web applications, VERY similar to React (But no shadow dom! ðŸ˜±).
